# The-Gaming-Room

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
I work for Creative Technology Solutions as a Technology Consultant and I have been assigned to work with our client, The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room has a game application called "Draw It or Lose It" for Android systems, and they want to offer this application to users on different platforms. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Addressing security concerns; I recommended encrypted data protocols like TLS/SSL can be used to secure communications as well as security checks that will review code and test for vulnerabilities. Using two-factor authentication and controlling assess will also improve security. TLS/SSL certificate costs can range from $8 to $1000, depending on the number of domains and validations.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The document outlines requirements needed for developing the code like using the singleton patters and encapsulation, recommends development tools, provides a UML diagram, and goes over unique naming requirements. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the memory management section to address the need to ensure there's enough memory to store image quickly to avoid slow loading times, and test these times to ensure a good user experience. I would also discuss aspects of Java memory management like garbage collection and memory optimization as I relates to images. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I needed to understand their requirements and expectations so the software would be well-recieved by the intended users. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because you want the app to be intuitive in design and effective when played. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I would have to understand and balance the client's requirements with the users expectations, break down the software into small pieces, and use iteration and testing to fine-tune the software based on feedback.
